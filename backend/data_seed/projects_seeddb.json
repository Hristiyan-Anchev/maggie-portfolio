    "mainDescription": "Green Whisk is a personal branding project, inspired by my obsession with matcha lattes. The logo represents a traditional bamboo whisk, used in the matcha preparation. The whisk is a stylised version, made of leaves, to symbolise the green tea. For the typography of the logo I chose ColorTube by Fontfabric, because I love the roundness of the letters and I think they compliment the strokes of the logo. For the branding typography I used Playfair Display, which is a serif font that compliments ColorTube. When it came time for the branding, I started off with the brand colours. Obviously I had to use this warm green colour as primary to represent the colour of matcha to the customers. I love using complementary colour schemes, so I pared the green with this warm rusty orange colour. I wanted this brand to be quite modern and quirky and to catch your attention, so I created this pattern of hand-drawn elements - a cup, whisk, leaves and a measuring spoon. I think the pattern is fresh and can be used in multiple different branding and marketing projects. ",

    "mainDescription": "Jolie Jewellery is a personal branding project I came up with. I was inspired by the french style, the beauty of jewellery and the way it makes you feel. This brand has a few shops, but most of the sales are completed online. The targeted demographic is mostly women aged 18-45, but still wanted to be inclusive to all genders. For this project I decided to go for a signature logo. Jolie is handwritten to add a personal touch and for Jewellery I used the font Lora, which is a very elegant serif font. For the brand colours I chose a warm pale yellow, a more saturated yellow, 2 olive colours and a very dark grey. I wanted to bring calmness and earthiness to the colour scheme, making it more inclusive and appealing to the customers. I also created an advertising poster for the brand. The image displays hands with rings and a bracelet. I edited the photo to fit the composition and colours I needed. I added the logo, a short copy to grab your attention and a playful ribbon around the hands, which is used in other parts of the branding.",

When I was creating the logo I really wanted to use a needle to show that this is a clothing brand. When brainstorming and sketching I came up with the idea to use the needle as the vertical line for the P and finish the abbreviation with a stroke resembling a thread. Since the thread is quite playful I decided to use the font Cormorant Infant, which is a selfie font that brings out the elegance and balances out the logo mark. When it comes to the colours I really liked the combination of pink and blue, which is feminine and masculine at the same time.",

I was inspired by my love for plants and wanted to create a branding for an online shop that delivers indoor and rare plants straight to your door. I wanted the brand to be modern and fresh. When creating the logo I wanted to use the name in the logo mark. I came up with a computer mouse, the cable of which is shaped like a Monstera plant in a pot. There is also a hidden C in the pot. I pared the stroke of the mark with the font Comfortaa that pairs well with the roundness of it. For colours I wanted to use the signature green, seen in a lot of plants, and compliment it with a warm pink. With the green colour, the brand stands out as peaceful and harmonious. We combine it with pink that symbolises care and nurture. This is not only a very pleasing to eye combination but it also works with the brandâ€™s mission, vision and customers.",

I created 48 illustrations, 6 banners and 5 icons. You can see a small part of them here or on the website <a href=\"https://opsidianet.eu/\">opsidianet.eu</a> The project was extremely interesting to me and I loved working on these illustrations. The team gave me a lot of freedom to portray the main characters and the situations. When creating them I wanted them to look quite modern and fresh, to keep the attention of the viewers. To achieve this I opted for a flat, minimalistic design, paired with complementary colours and textures. I truly enjoyed working on this project and working with the team from The Center for the Study of Democracy! It was not only educational but also really fun, and I would be overjoyed to work together in the future!",

We always want consistency when it comes to branding, so I kept my most loved colour palette of blue and orange. For the front of my cards I started with a self-portrait illustration that I quickly drew on my iPad and then digitalized it into a vector. I used my favourite font - Montserrat and to make the cards a bit more fun I created some flowy shapes. For the back I wanted to leave extra white space for writing purposes, so I used the same shapes for the background, my logo at the top and contacts at the bottom.\n",

I used key colours and elements for the front and back cover of the book and tried to make the design quite mysterious to keep the viewer's attention. You can see the sketches I created using my iPad Pro. After polishing the sketches and the layout I wanted, I moved to Adobe Illustrator and vectorized the illustrations. When I was happy with the colours and shapes of the illustrations I moved on to the typography. For the title and the authorâ€™s name, I used the font Lora. I chose this font because of the way the serifs are drawn - flowy with a vintage touch, which I think go very well with the concept of the book. For the synopsis, I used the font Roboto. Roboto is a very clean sans serif font with good readability, perfect for the summary of the book. I really enjoyed creating this design and would definitely try to do more projects like this!",
