    "mainDescription": "Green Whisk is a personal branding project, inspired by my obsession with matcha lattes. The logo represents a traditional bamboo whisk, used in the matcha preparation. The whisk is a stylised version, made of leaves, to symbolise the green tea. For the typography of the logo I chose ColorTube by Fontfabric, because I love the roundness of the letters and I think they compliment the strokes of the logo. For the branding typography I used Playfair Display, which is a serif font that compliments ColorTube. When it came time for the branding, I started off with the brand colours. Obviously I had to use this warm green colour as primary to represent the colour of matcha to the customers. I love using complementary colour schemes, so I pared the green with this warm rusty orange colour. I wanted this brand to be quite modern and quirky and to catch your attention, so I created this pattern of hand-drawn elements - a cup, whisk, leaves and a measuring spoon. I think the pattern is fresh and can be used in multiple different branding and marketing projects. ",

    "mainDescription": "Jolie Jewellery is a personal branding project I came up with. I was inspired by the french style, the beauty of jewellery and the way it makes you feel. This brand has a few shops, but most of the sales are completed online. The targeted demographic is mostly women aged 18-45, but still wanted to be inclusive to all genders. For this project I decided to go for a signature logo. Jolie is handwritten to add a personal touch and for Jewellery I used the font Lora, which is a very elegant serif font. For the brand colours I chose a warm pale yellow, a more saturated yellow, 2 olive colours and a very dark grey. I wanted to bring calmness and earthiness to the colour scheme, making it more inclusive and appealing to the customers. I also created an advertising poster for the brand. The image displays hands with rings and a bracelet. I edited the photo to fit the composition and colours I needed. I added the logo, a short copy to grab your attention and a playful ribbon around the hands, which is used in other parts of the branding.",

    "mainDescription": "Plain Threads is a logo prompt from the Daily Logo Challenge, that I decided to expand to a full branding project. When I was creating the logo I really wanted to use a needle to show that this is a clothing brand. When brainstorming and sketching I came up with the idea to use the needle as the vertical line for the P and finish the abbreviation with a stroke resembling a thread. Since the thread is quite playful I decided to use the font Cormorant Infant, which is a selfie font that brings out the elegance and balances out the logo mark. When it comes to the colours I really liked the combination of pink and blue, which is feminine and masculine at the same time.",

I was inspired by my love for plants and wanted to create a branding for an online shop that delivers indoor and rare plants straight to your door. I wanted the brand to be modern and fresh. When creating the logo I wanted to use the name in the logo mark. I came up with a computer mouse, the cable of which is shaped like a Monstera plant in a pot. There is also a hidden C in the pot. I pared the stroke of the mark with the font Comfortaa that pairs well with the roundness of it. For colours I wanted to use the signature green, seen in a lot of plants, and compliment it with a warm pink. With the green colour, the brand stands out as peaceful and harmonious. We combine it with pink that symbolises care and nurture. This is not only a very pleasing to eye combination but it also works with the brandâ€™s mission, vision and customers.",
